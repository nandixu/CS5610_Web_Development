# Writeup of Project3 JobBoard Nandi Xu:

## Challenges:
The biggest challenge is authentication and authorization. I chose to use session authorization as my approach because it was easy to understand and relatively easy to deploy.
There are also a lot of configeration challenges such as the installation of most packages and the sequence of most codes. I spent a lot of time on figuring a tiny grammar problem, and this situation is supposed to be avoided.

## Additional Features:
I would write a job recommendation that would recommend certain jobs based on users' preference

## Assumptions I made:
The players do not click on weird places, do not click a button 100 times per second, and hopefully follow the instructions.

## How long does it take:
30+ hours in two weeks

## Bonus points:
I tried out some bonus points. The passwords are encrypted by using bycript, and users are directed correctly to the pages as required. The project with most basic functions are
uploaded on Monday, and some modifications are done after that time.
